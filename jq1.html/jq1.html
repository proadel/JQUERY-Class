        Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages ===================================
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You 
        can: - Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
             - Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        Downloading jQuery ================================================
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:

        - Production version - this is for your live website because it has 
          been minified and compressed
        - Development version - this is for testing and development 
          (uncompressed and readable code)
        - Both versions can be downloaded from  http://jquery.com/download/
          
        The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it 
        with the HTML script tag (notice that the script tag should be 
        inside the head section):
        <!-- <head><script src="jquery-3.6.1.min.js"></script></head> -->
        Tip: Place the downloaded file in the same directory as the pages 
        where you wish to use it.
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        jQuery CDN ========================================================
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can 
        include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
        Google is an example of someone who host jQuery:
        <!-- Google CDN: <head><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.1/jquery.min.js"></script></head>
         -->
        ===================================================================
        One big advantage of using the hosted jQuery from Google: 
        Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google when visiting 
        another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they 
        visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most 
        CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it 
        will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to 
        faster loading time
        ===================================================================
